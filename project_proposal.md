# Blockchain Gossip Network Project Proposal

## Overview
This project aims to implement a simplified blockchain network that utilizes a gossip protocol for transaction propagation between nodes. The gossip protocol will enable efficient broadcasting of transactions across the network, ensuring all nodes maintain a consistent view of the blockchain state.

## Technical Specifications

### Network Protocol
- Primary: TCP for reliable transaction transmission
- Secondary: UDP for network discovery and heartbeats
- Custom Gossip Protocol for efficient transaction propagation

### Core Components

1. **Node Management**
   - Peer discovery and connection handling
   - Node registration and heartbeat mechanism
   - Peer list maintenance

2. **Transaction Handling**
   - Transaction creation and validation
   - Transaction pool management
   - Gossip-based transaction propagation

3. **Blockchain Implementation**
   - Block structure and validation
   - Chain management and consensus
   - Simple Proof-of-Work implementation (bonus feature)

4. **Network Visualization**
   - Real-time network topology visualization
   - Transaction propagation visualization
   - Block mining and chain status display

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Network Infrastructure
- Implement basic node functionality
- Develop peer discovery mechanism
- Create connection management system

### Phase 2: Gossip Protocol Implementation
- Design and implement the gossip protocol
- Develop transaction broadcasting mechanism
- Implement anti-entropy and reconciliation mechanisms

### Phase 3: Blockchain Integration

- Add mining capabilities to nodes
- Develop chain selection and fork resolution

### Phase 5: Visualization and Testing
- Create network visualization tools
- Implement comprehensive testing framework
- Perform network simulation and stress testing

## Expected Outcomes

1. A functional peer-to-peer network using gossip protocol
2. Efficient transaction propagation across the network
3. Basic blockchain implementation with transaction validation
4. Network visualization tools for monitoring and analysis
5. Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism (bonus feature)
